There are three modules: presentation, domain and data. In presentation module I've created the user interface and the Application class, introduce dependencies. In that module I had used rxjava, rxkotlin, data binding. In domain module I had created all the entities, that I want to use in presentation, made repository interface and usecases. There are rxjava and rxkotlin libraries too. In data module make possible to interaction with local databases, I had created entities, dao interface, which implement the repository. In that module I had added room database.
