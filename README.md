There are three modules: presentation, domain and data. In presentation module I've created the user interface. In that module I had used rxjava, rxkotlin, data binding and Glide lib for images. In domain module I had created all the entities, that I want to use in presentation, made repository interface and usecases. There are rxjava and rxkotlin libraries too. In data module I had created entities and implement the repository. In that module I had added restApi as our products repository.
